    "> This notebook will introduce the steps to use the server api to decide if a new publication belongs to an author in academicworld database\n",
    "1. Connect to the UIUC VPN.\n",
    "2. Send a GET request to http://128.174.136.27:5000 with following parameters included:\n",
    "    + **target**: integer, the id of the author in academicworld database\n",
    "    + **title**: string, the title of the new publication\n",
    "    + **abstract**: string, the abstract for the new publication\n",
    "3. The feedback is a string in JSON format. The feedback contains the following fields:\n",
    "    + **co_author_score**: float, the score describe how likely the new publication is published by this author from the co-author perspective\n",
    "    + **co_author_conclusion**: boolean, according to the **co_author_score**, whether this new publication should belong to this author (emperical threshold: 0.65)\n",
    "    + **semantic_score**: float, the score describe how likely the new publication is published by this author from the semantic perspective\n",
    "    + **semantic_conclusion**: boolean, according to the **semantic_score**, whether this new publication should belong to this author (emperical threshold: 0.73)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "+ Since querying the whole Microsoft Academic Graph for co-author measure is still too time consuming in real time, we use a smaller collection focused on publication in CS domain. Therefore, the **co_author_score** may be **not available** due to some \"author not found\" or \"publication not found\" cases. In those cases, the **co_author_score** will be *null* and **co_author_conclusion** will be *false*.\n",
    "+ On the other hand, **semantic_score** and **semantic_conclusion** will always be available if the inputs are all valid.\n",
